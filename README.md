# ebay-seller-blacklist-plugin
A plugin for chrome and firefox which avoids accidental buying again from bad ebay sellers

Ebay does not offer a blacklist for bad sellers. The goal of this plugin is to set up a blacklist of bad ebay sellers and some way to make it impossible to buy from the same seller again accidentally by giving out a warning and disabling the buy and bet buttons.

The plugin is planned to be implemented for chrome / chromium and firefox browsers.
